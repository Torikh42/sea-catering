## Running the Project Locally

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd sea-catering
```

3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

4. Set Up Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables to connect to your Supabase project.

a. Rename the example file:

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` in the root of your project

b. Find your Supabase keys:

Go to your Supabase project dashboard.

- Navigate to Project Settings -> Data API and API Keys.
- You will find your Project URL and Project API Keys.

c. Find your Database Connection String:

Navigate to your Project and click the top connect button. in the connection string tab, scroll down and copy your session pooler key. Make sure to replace [YOUR-PASSWORD] with your actual database password when you first create the supabase project.

d. Update the `.env` file:

Open the newly renamed `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual keys from Supabase. It should look like this:

```
# Supabase Project URL and Anon Key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[Your Project URL]
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="[YOUR_ANON_KEY]"

# Supabase Service Role Key (for server-side operations, e.g., middleware)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="[YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY]"

# Your site's URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# This is for ORM/Drizzle/Prisma
DATABASE_URL=[Your Database Connection String].
You can find it in your project by click the connect button in the top and scroll down to session pooler. change the [YOUR-PASSWORD] with your password when you first time create the supabase project
```

5. Set up the Database Schema

If you are setting up a new Supabase project, you need to apply the database schema. This project uses Prisma for schema management.

a. Push the schema to your database:
Run the Prisma command to sync your schema with the database.

```bash
npm run migrate
```

This command is a shortcut for `npx prisma generate` && `npx prisma migrate dev. It will apply any new changes from your schema.prisma to the database.

b. Run seed script:
If you need to populate your database with initial data, run the seed script:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

6. Run the Development Server
   Once all dependencies and environment variables are set up, you can start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npx run dev
```

The site should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

7. how to make an admin account

When a user first signs up, their account is automatically created with a user role. To grant a user admin privileges, you need to update their metadata

To update the role, follow these steps:

a. Go to your Supabase Dashboard and navigate to the `SQL Editor`.

b. Execute the following SQL query

```bash
UPDATE auth.users
SET raw_user_meta_data = raw_user_meta_data || '{"role": "admin"}'
WHERE id = '{your account id}';
```

**Remember to replace `{your account id}` with the actual UUID of the user account you want to promote.** You can find the user's ID in the `Authentication` tab of your Supabase Dashboard.
